# Syntax highlighting for JavaScript heredocs in Ruby

Heavily based on [aliou/sql-heredoc.vim](https://github.com/aliou/sql-heredoc.vim). Which is released under the terms of the Vim license (see `:help license`).

To install, drop `after/sintax/ruby.vim` into the appropriate location, or clone this repository into the proper location for whatever vim plugin manager you use.
